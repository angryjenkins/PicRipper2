# My new Picture Ripper.

I've decided to remake my picture ripper with Bootstrap and MySQL.
I've been having issues with promises using mongo, and was also looking to use the most recent version of Bootstrap.

## Proper installation:
Both npm and bower are used to serve packages to this app.
Not only must the node modules be installed: `npm i` ,,.
The bower components in the /public folder must also be installed: `bower i`
